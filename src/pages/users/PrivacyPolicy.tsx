                                    for recruitment purposes for example psychometric

                                    Those general exclusions include where processing is necessary: 
                                    for exercising the right of freedom of expression and 
                                    information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or 
                                    for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

                                    data for the purposes of our processing, but you require 
                                    personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence
